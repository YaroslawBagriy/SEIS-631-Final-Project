    "# Dive into Data \"by Metro\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we see here is really two data tables, connected via primary/foreign key. One data table is the geographical dimension. This table consists of the primary key of metro area or \"RegionName\" in this table as well as the RegionID, SizeRank, RegionType and StateName columns. The other table is a fact table that contains date, ZHVI and metro data. TThis table has a composite primary key consisting of date and metro and then continuous data, ZHVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to drop geographically related columns, apart from the Metro then I want to \"Tidy\" data. Tidying is structuring the data in a way that makes it easy for a computer to navigate. If you've worked with relational databases, its the structure that exists there. If you want more information on Tidy Data, read this paper (https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for tidy data are each row is an observation and each column is a fact about an observation. I'm going to bring in a bunch of data at the **Metro** level only. I'm also going to pull geo data beyond \"metro\" out. It can be easily re-added later via a join with the Metro columns acting as a key.\n",

    "I'm going to repeat this for a bunch of different variables for metro. The hope is to find patterns in the data that can help to pinpoint metros that will be good candidates for investment"

This metro is hot, has low time to sale and pending. Lower inventory. These zip codes have a high projected growth rate. Homes are inexpensive here. \n",

    "If we're investing in an area there are two ways to make money, from rent or from appreciation. I want to visualize what the price level is on a property, what can be made from rent and forecasted appreciation on the same graph. To do that I'm going to gather data by zip code and combine ZHVI and ZORI into a single value (divide ZORI which is should track to revenue by ZHVI which tracks to cost) and plot against Projected 12M growth rate.\n",

    "We pulled a bunch of geographhically diverse zip codes that we can potentially invest in that should maximize returns both from value appreciation over one year and also from rental income. In this list are both homes at the lower end of the value spectrum and some more \"luxuy\" type real estate with higher values.\n",

    "We have a bunch of zip codes both from our \"hottest\" metro areas which is the most tighly correlated statistic with forward looking growth. While it is the single best correlation, the correlation coefficient is still only approximately 0.3. Looking into the forecasted growth rates from the zip codes in the top 10 metro areas by MHI, zip codes from Lewiston-Auburn, ME metro area had the highest forecasted 12M growth rate. \n",

    "We wanted to get a more holistic view of potential areas to invest. To do this we analyzed data with a view both forecasted value appreciation and the ratio of rental index (ZORI) to property value index (ZHVI) by zip code. Analyzing this data on the zip code level allowed us to narrow down investment opportunities from a wider geogrpahical variety of zip codes as well as a wider variety of price points.
