# SEIS-631-Final-Project
The final project for class SEIS-631 at the University of St. Thomas

I am a real estate investor and would like to invest 12M dollars in the real estate market. I am particularly interested in single family homes or rental apartments unless you recommend other types of real estate which may return maximum profits. My interest is to buy properties, do the upgrades and then rent the properties, however I am also interested in blooming markets where if needed, I can sell the properties quickly. What part of the country should I invest in to receive maximum gains.

1) Show me the market trends to help me decide. Which US real-estate market is doing best overall. 10 points

2) Are the sale prices and inventory listing going up or down overall in the US? 10 points 

3) Should I wait to invest or should I invest now and if so then where should I invest. (You could recommend more than one place)? 10 points

4) How long some of the real-estate stays on the market before they rent or sell? 10 points

5) How much average profit I could expect from my investments in terms of sale (% dollars) after paying mortgage. Calculate my ~ROI. 10 Points

6) How much average monthly income I could expect from my investments in terms of lease/rent after upgrading properties, paying mortgage, and paying taxes. Calculate my ~ROI. 10 Points

 

I like visuals thus show me many plots, charts, and graphs. (Bonus points) 20 Points

Video presentation (Everyone must participate in the video and identify what part they worked on including the coding) 20 Points
